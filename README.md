# Congressional-App-Challenge-2024

Please briefly describe what your app does.
My app is an engaging single-player game that simulates the experience of a blood drive. Players step into the shoes of a blood donor, navigating through interactive scenarios that replicate the donation process from registration and health screening to the actual donation and post-donation care. Throughout the game, players will encounter decision-making moments, illustrating the journey of a blood donor on the day of a drive.
The app’s primary goal is to educate and inspire users about the critical importance of blood donation, especially in light of the recent 25% drop in the national blood supply reported by the Red Cross. By gamifying this vital experience, I aimed to not only inform users about the donation process but also foster a community of dedicated donors ready to make a difference. With engaging graphics and interactive tasks, the app encourages players to take action and participate in local blood drives, ultimately helping to save lives.

What inspired you to create this app?
I have always been passionate about healthcare, biology, and STEM. During my freshman year of high school, my grandfather passed away in the hospital after a long battle with cancer. This experience profoundly impacted me and motivated me to seek ways to help others facing similar challenges in my community. I reached out to the Red Cross after discovering their website for Blood Program Leaders and how to host my own blood drive.
After ten months of meticulous planning, coordinating with my school administration and Red Cross representatives, managing social media communication, and sending what felt like hundreds of emails, I successfully hosted my first blood drive on campus earlier this month. This accomplishment not only fulfilled my desire to contribute but also deepened my understanding of community engagement.
About two to three months into the planning of the blood drive, my computer science teacher assigned a final project to code an app focused on a cause or activity that mattered to me. This was an exciting opportunity to connect my programming skills with a project I was already deeply invested in. My mind was fully occupied with the blood drive, and the final project became the perfect platform for me to showcase the Python skills I had acquired throughout the year while creating a meaningful resource to raise awareness about blood donation.

What technical difficulties did you face programming your app?
At the beginning of my project, I encountered significant difficulty with organizing groups of multiple labels across different screens. As a beginner programmer, the sheer number of elements and the syntax required to group them together felt overwhelming. I recognized that distinguishing these groups was crucial for making them visible or invisible and, therefore, interactive for the user. With perseverance and the diligent practice of commenting on lines of code, I was able to overcome this hurdle and successfully create a functional project.
The second major challenge I faced was working within the constraints of the platform I was using. My Intro to Programming course utilized Carnegie Mellon University’s CS Academy, which limited the app canvas to a mere 400 by 400 pixels. I envisioned a more visually appealing and complex app with a clear aesthetic, but CS Academy did not fully align with this vision. To work around this limitation, I began taking screenshots of the elements I wanted to incorporate and importing them into my program. While this method proved to be the simplest way to include images and enhance text display, it did come at the cost of some image sharpness.
Despite these technical challenges, I am proud of the creative solutions I developed to navigate these complications. These experiences not only helped me refine my programming skills but also fostered a sense of resilience and adaptability. I feel that I have grown significantly as a programmer through this process.

What improvements would you make if you were to create a 2.0 version of your app?
In a second, improved version of my app, I would focus on enhancing the quality of the visuals. A cleaner and more compatible set of elements would not only create a more cohesive aesthetic but also facilitate smoother navigation through the game. Additionally, I would add a function that highlights different lines of information in the donor screening form. Implementing a cursor effect would improve readability and user interaction, making dense text easier to digest.
I also received valuable feedback from the Red Cross representative I partnered with to organize my first blood drive on campus. While I was able to incorporate some of her suggestions into the initial version, the 2.0 update would integrate all of her revisions, ensuring that the app reflects the insights of an experienced professional in the field. This would not only improve the app's functionality but also deepen its impact in raising awareness about blood donation.
